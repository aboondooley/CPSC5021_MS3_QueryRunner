# CPSC5021_MS3_QueryRunner

Final project for CPSC 5021: Database Systems for the Computer Science Fundamentals Certificate at Seattle University.
We incorporated our database into a program that provides a GUI and console interface for the user to interact with the database. 
Our particular project was a site for Hikers to search for new hikes and log hikes they have done, as well as ratings. They can also purchase hiking products through our site.
